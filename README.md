## Battle of the DAOs: Rise to the Apex

Unleash the power of decentralized alliances in DaoVsDao, an immersive blockchain game that challenges you to strategize, climb the ranks, and dominate the map alongside your allies. Test the limits of DAO structures and explore new ways to organize in this thrilling, high-stakes competition for resources.

## Rules

1. **Select a Starting Location**: Choose a starting point on the triangular map; higher positions offer greater earnings.
2. **Earn DVD Tokens**: Collect DVD tokens, the in-game currency, by playing and climbing the map.
3. **Token Power**: Power is determined by the amount of DVD tokens held; attack neighbors with fewer tokens to seize a percentage of their tokens and swap your position.
4. **ERC20 Tokens**: DVD tokens are ERC20 tokens, tradable, lendable, or usable in liquidity pools.
5. **Recovery States**: After an attack, players enter a 24-hour recovery state. Post-attacking, there's a 12-hour dormant state, with a double penalty if attacked during this time.

## Features

- **Sponsorships**: Lend DVD tokens to other players and participate in their profits or risk losing part of your lending if attacked.
- **NFT Sponsorships**: Track sponsorships via NFTs, which can be bought, sold, and exchanged on OpenSea.
- **In-Game Chat**: Communicate with neighboring players through the chat feature and move conversations to more secure platforms if necessary.
- **News Feed**: Stay updated on the latest moves and strategies of other players in the game.

DaoVsDao is a groundbreaking strategy game that emphasizes collaboration, resource management, and innovative DAO structures. Engage with other players, forge powerful alliances, and battle your way to the top in this exciting, ever-evolving game.
